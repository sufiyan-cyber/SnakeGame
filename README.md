# SnakeGame
The famous nokia snake game using python
In this project we are using the concept of oops in python creating snake object using snake class,a seperate class for food , and scoreboard class to keep score
The turtle module is used extensively for creating the snake body and increasing size
when the top head of snake is near enough to food which is also another turtle object it should reappear elsehwere and simultaneously 
game ends if snake hits wall or its own tail
